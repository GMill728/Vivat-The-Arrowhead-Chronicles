//L - I was testing using an external script to trigger dialogue. 
//      Will either update or put trigger dialogue function in another, more appropriate, script.

using UnityEngine;

public class playerActions : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Return))
        {
            //player triggers dialogue (change return to "F" as well)
        }
    }
}
