      around is desolate and your colleagues return from a long day in the mines. 
      They have raw rings around their ankles where their shackles once were and
      they look more tired than they ever have.  One man collapses as he tries to
      open his door.  You rush over and attempt to help but he is already dead. 
      You wonder if this was the right decision, if this wasn\u2019t your problem
      then why wasn\u2019t it anyone else\u2019s?  Is it too late to change your
      mind?"

      confront you before you can get far and offer a careful welcome. Seeing their
      guarded expressions, you bring out  the arrow head as you were instructed and
      report that Riser Nine had sent you. Upon hearing your words, many commoners
      like yourself now turned towards you with more hope than you\u2019ve ever seen
      before in their eyes, as one of them questions you with disbelief, \u201CYou\u2019ve
