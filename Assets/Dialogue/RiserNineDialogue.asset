      whispers throughout the kingdom of one man who wanted to rally the people against
      the Dominus Nihili. No one\u2019s sure who he was. But, he gathered enough
      people for a small army at the central fountain in the 7th district. He spoke
      to them. He spoke of freedom, of fighting back against Nihili, those nobles
      who do nothing but splunder the spoils of this land. The crowd became increasingly
      more untamed as he spoke. A spark was lit. And to extinguish it, a single arrow
      was put through the skull of that man. It might have smoldered the flame for
      a bit, but it was not long before it was ablaze. "

      first spark, a few of us had tried to topple some of the citadels with raids.
      They were unsuccessful at first, until we had one of the guards inside one
      of the citadels join our side. He knew the patrols routes, number of guards,
      and the most opportune time to go. It was our first successful raid. We worked
      to get more of our men in the guards\u2019 ranks so we could better find the
      weakest points to strike. There are more like me scattered at different stations
      throughout the kingdom. This is my assignment; to learn the layout and patrol
      routes throughout this dungeon to find the best way to break my fellow arrowheads
      out. But I have not yet figured out the best way to conduct a mass escape.
      Perhaps you could do me a favor?"
